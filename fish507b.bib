  abstract = {Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from the diverse fields of computer science and computational science to create a new approach to numerical computing. Julia is designed to be easy and fast. Julia questions notions generally held as "laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: 1. High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. 2. One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment, and 3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts. We introduce the Julia programming language and its design --- a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can have machine performance without sacrificing human convenience.},

While the use of more advanced statistical methods has helped catch rates to be standardised against many explanatory variables, the changing spatial characteristics of most fisheries data sets provide additional challenges for constructing reliable indices of stock abundance. After reviewing the use of general linear models to construct indices of annual stock abundance, potential biases which can arise due to the unequal and changing nature of the spatial distribution of fishing effort are examined and illustrated through the analysis of simulated data. Finally, some options are suggested for modelling catch rates in unfished strata and for accounting for the uncertainties in the stock and fishery dynamics which arise in the interpretation of spatially varying catch rate data.},

  abstract = {1.Population surveys are often used to estimate the density, abundance, or distribution of natural populations. Recently, model-based approaches to analyzing survey data have become popular because one can more readily accommodate departures from pre-planned survey routes and construct more detailed maps than one can with design-based procedures. 2.Spatial models for population distributions (SMPDs) often make the implicit assumption that locations chosen for sampling and animal abundance at those locations are conditionally independent given modelled covariates. However, this assumption may be violated when survey effort is non-randomized, leading to preferential sampling. 3.We develop a hierarchical statistical modelling framework for detecting and alleviating the biasing effects of preferential sampling in spatial distribution models fitted to count data. The approach works by specifying a joint model for population density and the locations selected for sampling, and specifying a dependent correlation structure between the two processes. 4.Using simulation, we show that moderate levels of preferential sampling can lead to large (e.g. 40\%) bias in estimates of animal density and that our modelling approach can considerably reduce this bias. In contrast, preferential sampling did not appear to bias inferences about parameters informing species\textendash habitat relationships (i.e. slope parameters). 5.We apply our approach to aerial survey counts of bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) in the eastern Bering Sea. As expected, models with a preferential sampling effect led to lower abundance than those without. However, several lines of reasoning (better predictive performance, higher biological realism) led us to prefer models without a preferential sampling effect for this dataset. 6.When population surveys break from traditional scientific survey design principles, ecologists should recognize the potentially biasing effects of preferential sampling when estimating population density or occurrence. Joint models, such as those described in this paper, can be used to test and correct for such biases. However, such models can be unstable; ultimately the best way to avoid preferential sampling bias is to incorporate design-based principles such as randomization and/or systematic sampling into survey design.},

Preferential sampling arises when the process that determines the data locations and the process being modelled are stochastically dependent. Conventional geostatistical methods assume, if only implicitly, that sampling is non-preferential. However, these methods are often used in situations where sampling is likely to be preferential. For example, in mineral exploration, samples may be concentrated in areas that are thought likely to yield high grade ore. We give a general expression for the likelihood function of preferentially sampled geostatistical data and describe how this can be evaluated approximately by using Monte Carlo methods. We present a model for preferential sampling and demonstrate through simulated examples that ignoring preferential sampling can lead to misleading inferences. We describe an application of the model to a set of biomonitoring data from Galicia, northern Spain, in which making allowance for preferential sampling materially changes the results of the analysis.},

  abstract = {In the last 25 years there has been an important increase in the amount of data collected from animal-mounted sensors (bio-probes), which are often used to study the animals' behaviour or environment. We focus here on an example of the latter, where the interest is in sea surface temperature (SST), and measurements are taken from sensors mounted on Elephant Seals in the Southern Indian ocean. We show that standard geostatistical models may not be reliable for this type of data, due to the possibility that the regions visited by the animals may depend on the SST. This phenomenon is known in the literature as preferential sampling, and, if ignored, it may affect the resulting spatial predictions and parameter estimates. Research on this topic has been mostly restricted to stationary sampling locations such as monitoring sites. The main contribution of this manuscript is to extend this methodology to observations obtained by devices that move through the region of interest, as is the case with the tagged seals. More specifically, we propose a flexible framework for inference on preferentially sampled fields, where the process that generates the sampling locations is stochastic and moving over time through a 2-dimensional space. Our simulation studies confirm that predictions obtained from the preferential sampling model are more reliable when this phenomenon is present, and they compare very well to the standard ones when there is no preferential sampling. Finally, we note that the conclusions of our analysis of the SST data can change considerably when we incorporate preferential sampling in the model.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are now being widely used in ecology for management and conservation purposes across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. The increasing interest in SDMs has drawn the attention of ecologists to spatial models and, in particular, to geostatistical models, which are used to associate observations of species occurrence or abundance with environmental covariates in a finite number of locations in order to predict where (and how much of) a species is likely to be present in unsampled locations. Standard geostatistical methodology assumes that the choice of sampling locations is independent of the values of the variable of interest. However, in natural environments, due to practical limitations related to time and financial constraints, this theoretical assumption is often violated. In fact, data commonly derive from opportunistic sampling (e.g., whale or bird watching), in which observers tend to look for a specific species in areas where they expect to find it. These are examples of what is referred to as preferential sampling, which can lead to biased predictions of the distribution of the species. The aim of this study is to discuss a SDM that addresses this problem and that it is more computationally efficient than existing MCMC methods. From a statistical point of view, we interpret the data as a marked point pattern, where the sampling locations form a point pattern and the measurements taken in those locations (i.e., species abundance or occurrence) are the associated marks. Inference and prediction of species distribution is performed using a Bayesian approach, and integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) methodology and software are used for model fitting to minimize the computational burden. We show that abundance is highly overestimated at low abundance locations when preferential sampling effects not accounted for, in both a simulated example and a practical application using fishery data. This highlights that ecologists should be aware of the potential bias resulting from preferential sampling and account for it in a model when a survey is based on non-randomized and/or non-systematic sampling.},

  abstract = {Statistical models supporting inferences about species occurrence patterns in relation to environmental gradients are fundamental to ecology and conservation biology. A common implicit assumption is that the sampling design is ignorable and does not need to be formally accounted for in analyses. The analyst assumes data are representative of the desired population and statistical modeling proceeds. However, if data sets from probability and non-probability surveys are combined or unequal selection probabilities are used, the design may be non-ignorable. We outline the use of pseudo-maximum likelihood estimation for site-occupancy models to account for such non-ignorable survey designs. This estimation method accounts for the survey design by properly weighting the pseudo-likelihood equation. In our empirical example, legacy and newer randomly selected locations were surveyed for bats to bridge a historic statewide effort with an ongoing nationwide program. We provide a worked example using bat acoustic detection/non-detection data and show how analysts can diagnose whether their design is ignorable. Using simulations we assessed whether our approach is viable for modeling data sets composed of sites contributed outside of a probability design. Pseudo-maximum likelihood estimates differed from the usual maximum likelihood occupancy estimates for some bat species. Using simulations we show the maximum likelihood estimator of species\textendash environment relationships with non-ignorable sampling designs was biased, whereas the pseudo-likelihood estimator was design unbiased. However, in our simulation study the designs composed of a large proportion of legacy or non-probability sites resulted in estimation issues for standard errors. These issues were likely a result of highly variable weights confounded by small sample sizes (5\% or 10\% sampling intensity and four revisits). Aggregating data sets from multiple sources logically supports larger sample sizes and potentially increases spatial extents for statistical inferences. Our results suggest that ignoring the mechanism for how locations were selected for data collection (e.g., the sampling design) could result in erroneous model-based conclusions. Therefore, in order to ensure robust and defensible recommendations for evidence-based conservation decision-making, the survey design information in addition to the data themselves must be available for analysts. Details for constructing the weights used in estimation and code for implementation are provided.},

Many citizen science projects have the flexibility for participants to select where they survey, resulting in more participants, but also spatially biased data. It is important to assess the extent to which these spatially biased data can provide reliable estimates of species distributions. Here we quantify the extent of site selection bias in a citizen science project and the implications of this spatial bias in species distribution models. Using data from the BirdTrack citizen science project in Great Britain from 2007 to 2011, we modelled the spatial bias of data submissions. We next produced species occupancy models for 138 bird species, and assessed the impact of accounting for spatial bias. We compared the distributions to those produced using unbiased data from an Atlas survey from the same region and time period. Averaging across 138 species, models with spatially biased data produced accurate and precise estimates of species occupancy for most locations in Great Britain. However, these distributions were both less accurate and less precise in the Scottish Highlands, showing on average a positive bias. Accounting for the spatially biased sampling with weights led to on average greater accuracy in the Scottish Highlands, but did not increase precision. This region is both distinct in environmental characteristics and has a low density of observations, making it difficult to characterise environmental relationships with species occupancy. Accounting for the spatially biased sampling did not affect average accuracy or precision throughout most of the country. Spatially biased citizen science data can be used to estimate species occupancy in regions with stationary environmental relationships and good sampling across environmental space. The reliability of estimated species distributions from spatially biased data should be further validated and tested under a range of different scenarios.},

AIV is an important output from surveys and is commonly used in formal assessments of survey quality, in survey comparison studies, and in stock assessments. However, uncertainty in AIV estimates is poorly understood and studies on the precision and bias in survey AIV estimates are lacking. Typically, AIV estimates are ``design based'' and are derived from sampling theory under some aspect of randomized samples. Inference on population density in these cases can be confounded by unaccounted process errors such as those due to variable sampling efficiency (q). Here, we simulated fish distribution and surveys to assess the effect of q and variance in q on design-based estimates of AIV. Simulation results show that the bias and precision of AIV depend on the mean q and variance in q. We conclude that to fully evaluate the reliability of AI, both observation error and variability in q must be accounted for when estimating AIV. A decrease in mean q and an increase in the variance in q results in increased bias and decreased precision in survey AIV estimates. These effects are likely small in surveys with mean q {$\geq$} 1. However, for surveys where q {$\leq$} 0.5, these effects can be large. Regardless of the survey type, AIV estimates can be improved with knowledge of q and variance in q.},

  abstract = {Estimating indices of abundance from fishery-dependent data requires that catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) be standardized to account for factors that may have affected CPUE but are not related to changes in abundance. Such standardization is particularly important for highly migratory species (e.g., tunas, pelagic sharks, and billfishes), because of time-varying mismatches between distributions of abundance and the distribution of fishing effort. Two commonly applied methods for standardizing CPUE are generalized linear models (GLMs), which can account for changes in fishing practices in a straightforward linear fashion, and habitat-based standardizations (e.g., statHBS), which use nonlinear analysis to relate the distribution of fishing effort to the species distribution. We evaluated the accuracy of these methods over three patterns in vertical catchability as related to ocean temperature profiles, and 50 possible biomass trajectories using a simulation framework that followed the general effort dynamics of the Japanese longline fishery in the Atlantic Ocean from 1956 to 2009. Additionally, we propose a method for directly incorporating vertical habitat information into the linear models. Overall, we found the most accurate approach to be a delta-lognormal GLM with our unique habitat factor. The statHBS approach was the most accurate when catchability was simulated to peak in surface waters. However, statHBS was much more sensitive to errors in estimates of longline hook depths (i.e., habitats exploited). Based on these results, we recommend that relative abundance be estimated for highly migratory species following a delta-GLM approach that considers vertical habitats fished.},

  abstract = {Estimating trends in abundance from fishery catch rates is one of the oldest endeavors in fisheries science. However, many jurisdictions do not analyze fishery catch rates due to concerns that these data confound changes in fishing behavior (adjustments in fishing location or gear operation) with trends in abundance. In response, we developed a spatial dynamic factor analysis (SDFA) model that decomposes covariation in multispecies catch rates into components representing spatial variation and fishing behavior. SDFA estimates spatiotemporal variation in fish density for multiple species and accounts for fisher behavior at large spatial scales (i.e., choice of fishing location) while controlling for fisher behavior at fine spatial scales (e.g., daily timing of fishing activity). We first use a multispecies simulation experiment to show that SDFA decreases bias in abundance indices relative to ignoring spatial adjustments and fishing tactics. We then present results for a case study involving petrale sole (...},

  abstract = {This paper presents a general model framework for detecting the preferential sampling of environmental monitors recording an environmental process across space and/or time. This is achieved by considering the joint distribution of an environmental process with a site-selection process that considers where and when sites are placed to measure the process. The environmental process may be spatial, temporal or spatio-temporal in nature. By sharing random effects between the two processes, the joint model is able to establish whether site placement was stochastically dependent of the environmental process under study. Furthermore, if stochastic dependence is identified between the two processes, then inferences about the probability distribution of the spatio-temporal process will change, as will predictions made of the process across space and time. The embedding into a spatio-temporal framework also allows for the modelling of the dynamic site-selection process itself. Real-world factors affecting both the size and location of the network can be easily modelled and quantified. The general framework developed in this paper is designed to be easily and quickly fit using the R-INLA package. We apply this framework to a case study involving particulate air pollution over the UK where a major reduction in the size of a monitoring network through time occurred. It is demonstrated that a significant response-biased reduction in the air quality monitoring network occurred. We also show that the network was consistently unrepresentative of the levels of particulate matter seen across much of Great Britain throughout the operating life of the network. This may have led to a severe over-reporting of the levels across much of Great Britain.},
